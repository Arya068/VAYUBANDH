**🔥 Heat Wearable App – VayuBandh**

*“Feel the Climate. Wear the Future"*

Welcome to **ClimaSense**– a lightweight, browser-based prototype of a **heat wearable app**, built entirely using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

This project is designed to demonstrate how wearable technology can help us **monitor external climatic conditions** in real time, promote weather safety, and improve daily decision-making.

🧩 Tech Stack

- 💻 **HTML** – Structure of the app interface
- 🎨 **CSS** – Styling and responsive design
- ⚙️ **JavaScript** – Interactivity, logic, and simulated data

🎯 Project Goals

- Build a simple **front-end simulation** of a heat-sensing wearable
- Provide a **real-time feel** of climate detection (via mock data or APIs)
- Deliver a clean, **user-friendly UI** with alerts and climate information
- Help users **understand when the environment may be too hot or cold**

 🌟 Features

- 🌡️ Displays current (simulated or real) **temperature data**
- 🔔 **Smart alerts** for extreme heat or cold conditions
- 📊 Basic visualization using styled HTML elements
- 🧠 Simple logic for evaluating safe or unsafe temperature ranges

🚀 How to Run the App

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Explore the temperature readings and alerts.
